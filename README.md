# Kibria Portfolio (React + Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind)

A clean, modern portfolio built with **latest front‑end tooling**.

## Quick start
```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```

## Deploy to GitHub Pages
1. Put your assets in `public/`:
   - `public/me.jpeg`
   - `public/CV_Abdulla_Al_Kibria.pdf`
2. Commit & push to any host (Netlify, Vercel, Surge, Firebase Hosting) or GH Pages via a static export:
   - Build: `npm run build`
   - Serve locally: `npm run preview`

## Customize
- Update structured data in `src/data.ts`.
- Add images/screenshots to `public/` and reference them in your project cards.
- Styles are Tailwind-based; utility classes live inline in components.

Built with ❤️ using React 18, Vite 5, Tailwind 3, Framer Motion, and Lucide icons.
